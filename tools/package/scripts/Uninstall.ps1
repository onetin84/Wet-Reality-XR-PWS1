# Wet Reality XR Mod (PowerWash Simulator 1) - uninstaller, ported from PWS2
#
# Removes ONLY what this mod's installer created, identified through the manifest
# it wrote.
#
# Three kinds of entry, each undone its own way:
#
#   file      removed only while it still has the hash it was installed with.
#             One the user has since replaced is left alone and reported.
#   tree      a whole directory the installer unpacked - MelonLoader\ and
#             dotnet\. Recorded ONLY when the installer created it, so a
#             MelonLoader that was already there is never in the manifest and
#             therefore never removed.
#   cfg-key   a single key written into MelonLoader's Loader.cfg, reset to empty
#             rather than deleted - the file is MelonLoader's.
